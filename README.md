# yohane

Takes a song and its lyrics, extracts the vocals, splits the syllables and computes a forced alignment to generate a karaoke in an [Aegisub](https://aegisub.org) subtitles file (.ass).

This script is optimized for Japanese songs.

## Getting Started

**Requirements:**

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Japan7/yohane.git
cd yohane/
poetry install --only main
poetry run yohane
```

For a ~4 min song, on a MacBook Pro 2018 (i5-8259U), CPU only:

- Vocals extraction takes ~5 min
- Forced alignment takes 5-10 min

## Sample

[Aqours - PV - HAPPY PARTY TRAIN](https://hikari.butaishoujo.moe/v/9a11c0b1/Aqours%20-%20PV%20-%20HAPPY%20PARTY%20TRAIN.mp4) (hardsub extract, rev. [c43742c](https://github.com/Japan7/yohane/commit/c43742c1eb2ce9a86089a8d1b5fdc1fad458a91e))
